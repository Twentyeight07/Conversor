# Conversor

Initially, this was an app designed to learn Xamarin Forms, and it functioned as a cm to m converter. Later on, I decided to expand its functionality to currency exchange between Dollars and my local currency, bolivares.

## How it works? 

The app performs web scraping to retrieve the exchange rate of the day from a specific website and carries out conversion operations.
